## Introduction
HUAWEI Audio Editor Kit provides a wide range of audio editing capabilities, including audio import/expert/editing/extracting and format conversion. You can easily integrate them into your app as needed through the kit's open, excellent, yet easy-to-use APIs. This sample code is used to describe how to use the Audio Editor Kit SDK.

- Imports audio files in batches, and generates and previews the audio wave for a single audio or multiple audios.
- Supports basic audio editing operations such as changing the volume, adjusting the tempo or pitch, and copying and deleting audio.
- Adds one or more special effects to audio, including the music style, sound field, equalizer, fade-in/out, voice changer, sound effect, scene effect, and spatial audio
- Supports audio recording and importing.
- Separates audio sources for an audio file.
- Reduces the quasi-steady-state noises and sudden loud noises in audio collected from two microphones, and repairs and enhances the human voice to improve the audio quality.
- Extracts audio from video files in formats like MP4.
- Converts audio format to MP3, WAV, or FLAC.
